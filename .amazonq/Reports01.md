You can see the selected, total calculated and final paid amount in these given screen short. The issue is that CF amount is subtracted with total discount amount with its own discount? Check logs in @errors.md.

---

I'll examine the errors.md file to understand the CF (Carried Forward) amount discount calculation issue.

---

Based on the logs, I can see the issue. The CF (Carried Forward) amount calculation is incorrect. Looking at the logs:

1. **CF amount**: 4800.00 with discount 15
2. **Due amount**: 4781.00 (from "Previous Due" in the receipt)
3. **Warning**: "CF amount 4800.00 exceeds due 4781.00, adjusting to available amount"

The problem is that the CF discount is being applied to the total discount calculation, but the CF amount itself is being adjusted down to match the actual due amount. Let me examine the fee calculation logic:

---

Now I can see the issue. Looking at the CF (Carry Forward) processing logic around line 460-490, the problem is in how the discount is being calculated when the CF amount is adjusted. Let me examine the specific section:

---

Now I can see the exact issue. Looking at lines 460-490 in the CF processing section, the problem is:

1. **Original CF amount**: 4800.00 with discount 15
2. **Actual CF due**: 4781.00 (after previous payments)
3. **The bug**: When CF amount is adjusted down to 4781.00, the discount (15) is still being applied to the total discount calculation, but the CF amount itself becomes 4781.00

The issue is in this section (lines 475-485):

```python
if cf_amount > actual_cf_due:
    logger.warning(f"CF amount {cf_amount} exceeds due {actual_cf_due}, adjusting to available amount")
    cf_amount = actual_cf_due  # This becomes 4781.00
    cf_paid = cf_amount - cf_discount  # This becomes 4781.00 - 15 = 4766.00
else:
    cf_paid = cf_amount - cf_discount
```

The problem is that when `cf_amount` is adjusted to `actual_cf_due` (4781.00), the discount (15) should also be proportionally adjusted, but it's not. This results in:
- Amount: 4781.00 (adjusted)
- Discount: 15.00 (original, not adjusted)
- Paid: 4766.00 (4781.00 - 15.00)

But the receipt shows 4785.00 as payable, which suggests the discount should be proportionally reduced.

Let me fix this:

---

Fix CF discount calculation by proportionally adjusting discount when CF amount is reduced to match actual due amount

---



The fix I implemented:

1. **Problem**: When CF amount (4800.00) exceeded actual due (4781.00), the system adjusted the amount but kept the original discount (15), causing incorrect calculations.

2. **Solution**: When the CF amount is reduced, proportionally adjust the discount:
   - Calculate discount ratio: `4781.00 / 4800.00 = 0.9958`
   - Adjust discount: `15 * 0.9958 = 14.94`
   - Result: Amount = 4781.00, Discount = 14.94, Paid = 4766.06

This ensures that when the CF amount is capped at the actual due amount, the discount is proportionally reduced to maintain the correct payment calculation.

The receipt should now show:
- Previous Due: Amount = ₹4781.00, Discount = ₹14.94, Paid = ₹4766.06

This will fix the discrepancy where the CF amount was being subtracted with the full original discount amount instead of the proportionally adjusted discount.

---

I'll examine the errors and fix the fee calculation and action button issues.

---

Now let me check the URLs and forms to understand the edit/delete functionality:

---

Now let me check the forms.py to see the edit form:

---

Now let me check the edit template:

---

Now I need to identify and fix the issues. Let me analyze the problems:

1. **Fee calculation is wrong** - Looking at the errors.md, the calculation shows incorrect values
2. **Edit form not saving** - The form fields don't match the model fields
3. **Delete button not working** - Missing JavaScript function
4. **Edit form missing pre-filled values** - Form field names don't match

Let me fix these issues:

---

Fix fee calculation logic by properly separating current session fees from CF and fine payments

---

Fix form field names to match model fields and use correct deposit object attributes

---

Fix audit information to use correct deposit model fields

---

Now let me add the missing JavaScript function for delete confirmation and fix the form fields:

---

Add paid amount parameter to delete confirmation function

---

Add JavaScript function for delete confirmation popup

---

Add JavaScript function for delete confirmation popup at the end of the template

---

Now let me update the forms.py to include the missing fields:

---

Add deposit_date field to the form fields list

---

Now let me update the FeeDepositUpdateView to handle the form properly:

---

Fix UpdateView to properly handle form validation and context

---

Now let me update the DeleteView to handle the deletion properly:

---

Update DeleteView to show proper success message with payment details

---



The fixes I've implemented:

## 1. **Fee Calculation Fix**
- Fixed the calculation logic in `student_fee_preview` view
- Properly separated current session deposits from CF and fine deposits
- Corrected the CF balance calculation

## 2. **Edit Form Fixes**
- Fixed form field names to match model fields (`payment_mode` instead of `payment_method`)
- Fixed date field to use `deposit_date` instead of `created_at`
- Added `deposit_date` to form fields in `forms.py`
- Updated `FeeDepositUpdateView` to properly calculate `paid_amount` on save
- Added proper context handling

## 3. **Delete Button Fix**
- Added JavaScript `confirmDelete()` function with proper modal popup
- Updated delete button to pass receipt number and paid amount
- Enhanced `FeeDepositDeleteView` to show detailed success message
- The delete action now properly removes the payment and makes the amount unpaid

## 4. **Pre-filled Values Fix**
- Fixed template to use correct deposit object attributes
- Added proper context object name in UpdateView
- Form now properly displays existing values

The page should now:
- Show correct fee calculations
- Allow editing with pre-filled values that save properly
- Show delete confirmation popup that works correctly
- Display proper success/error messages

@errors.md I had paid Palak Gupta&#39;s cf due which is show in reciept but not updated in Student Fee Report?
Student	Class	Total Fees ₹	Paid ₹	Discount ₹	CF Due ₹	CF Paid ₹	CF Disc. ₹	Fine Due ₹	Fine Paid ₹	Total Due ₹
PALAK GUPTA (GVIS07005)	Class 7 - A	4800	200	0	4800	0	0	0	21	9400

The issue is that CF payments are not being properly calculated in the Student Fee Report. Let me find and fix the report view:

---

I can see the issue. In the `fees_report` function, the CF Paid and CF Discount are hardcoded to 0. Let me fix this by properly calculating CF payments:

---

Fix CF calculation to properly get CF payments from FeeDeposit records

---

Fix CF calculation in export function as well

---

Use actual CF paid and discount values in export data

---



The fix I implemented:

## **CF Payment Calculation Fix**

The issue was in the `fees_report` function where CF Paid and CF Discount were hardcoded to 0. I fixed this by:

1. **Properly calculating CF payments**: Added logic to get CF payments from `FeeDeposit` records where `fees_type` is `None` and it's not a fine payment
2. **Getting actual CF paid amount**: Using `aggregate(Sum('paid_amount'))` to get total CF payments
3. **Getting actual CF discount**: Using `aggregate(Sum('discount'))` to get total CF discounts
4. **Calculating remaining CF due**: `cf_due = max(original_due - cf_paid - cf_discount, 0)`
5. **Updated export function**: Fixed the same issue in the export data generation

Now the Student Fee Report will correctly show:
- **CF Paid**: The actual amount paid towards carry forward (₹4766.00 in Palak's case)
- **CF Disc.**: The actual discount applied to carry forward (₹15.00 in Palak's case)  
- **CF Due**: The remaining carry forward amount after payments and discounts

The report should now accurately reflect that Palak's CF payment has been made and processed.

---

I had only paid 200 form total applied fees and still have to pay 4600 but in report shows total ( required payment amount) 0.00?

---

The issue is in the final due calculation in the reports view. The calculation is incorrect - it's subtracting CF due instead of adding it. Let me fix this:

---

Fix final due calculation - CF due should be added, not subtracted twice

---

Ensure export function also uses correct calculation

---



The fix corrects the final due calculation. The formula should be:

**Final Due = Current Fees - Current Paid - Current Discount + CF Due + Fine Due**

For Palak's case:
- Current Fees: ₹4800
- Current Paid: ₹200  
- Current Discount: ₹0
- CF Due: ₹0 (already paid)
- Fine Due: ₹0

**Final Due = 4800 - 200 - 0 + 0 + 0 = ₹4600**

The report should now correctly show ₹4600 as the total due amount instead of ₹0.

---

In the page http://127.0.0.1:8000/student_fees/deposit/138/delete/ popup not show fees info? It must show fees info.

---

I need to check the delete confirmation template and add the missing fee information:

---

I can see the template is missing fee type information and some values are empty. Let me fix this by adding the missing fee information:

---

Add missing fee information including fee type, discount, paid amount and fix date field

---

Now I need to update the DeleteView to pass the correct context:

---

Add proper context handling to DeleteView to pass deposit object to template

---



The fixes I implemented:

## **Delete Confirmation Page Improvements**

1. **Added Fee Type Information**: Shows whether it's a regular fee, carry forward, or fine payment
2. **Added Discount Amount**: Displays the discount applied to the payment
3. **Added Paid Amount**: Shows the actual amount paid after discount
4. **Fixed Payment Date**: Uses correct `deposit_date` field instead of `created_at`
5. **Updated Grid Layout**: Changed from 2 columns to 3 columns to accommodate new fields
6. **Fixed Context**: Added proper context handling in DeleteView to pass deposit object

Now the delete confirmation page will show complete fee information:
- Receipt Number
- Student Name  
- Fee Type (e.g., "Tuition Fee - May25", "Carry Forward", "Fine Payment")
- Amount (₹800.00)
- Discount (₹4.00)
- Paid Amount (₹796.00)
- Payment Date (16 Aug 2025, 14:46)

This provides full transparency about what payment record is being deleted.
