All operations are logged with appropriate levels:
- INFO: Successful operations
- WARNING: Non-critical issues
- ERROR: Failed operations
- DEBUG: Detailed debugging information

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Permission Denied**
   - Ensure user has required permissions
   - Check file system permissions for backup directory

2. **File Not Found**
   - Verify backup file exists in backup directory
   - Check file path security restrictions

3. **Invalid JSON Format**
   - Validate backup file structure
   - Use `backup_system verify` command

4. **Restore Failures**
   - Check database connectivity
   - Verify backup file integrity
   - Review error logs for details

### Debug Mode
Enable debug logging in settings:
```python
LOGGING = {
    'loggers': {
        'backup': {
            'level': 'DEBUG',
            'handlers': ['console', 'file'],
        }
    }
}
```

## Development
